# Scopus Checker
A python script to check which (Google Scholar) documents and citations are missing from Scopus.



## About The Project

If you ever had to cross-check which papers and citations Scopus forgot to index, you would know--it is not fun. This script may provide a little help with that. 

*Please notice that this is a rather unreliable tool, and should only be used for a rough first screening. I take no responsibility for any missed citations or documents. See the license for more information.*
